            <h2>Education</h2>    

                <h3>BACHELOR'S DEGREE in Modern Languages (2016-2019)</h3>
                    <p>My first level of higher education, specializing in English and German studies (history, language, culture). Also included an international study program in Germany for a semester.</p>
                
                <h3>POST-GRADUATE'S STUDIES in European Union Law (January-June 2023)</h3>
                    <p>During my higher studies, I took up a program on European Union Law to bolster my international studies knowledge. This did not provide a degree, only a completion diploma.</p>

                <h3>MASTER'S DEGREE in International Relations: Peace, Security and Development Studies (2021-2023)</h3>
                    <p>My highest academic achievement so far. I did my thesis on the Question of Taiwan, and also did an internship while writing it.</p>

                <h3>Independent Course on Full-stack Web Development (2023-2024)</h3>
                    <p>Likely what you want to see from your Web Developer. My education on web development came from a Udemy independent course which taught me everything I needed to know to become a freelance, 
                        full-stack web developer. Languages and libraries under my belt include HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL, React.js, jQuery, etc.
