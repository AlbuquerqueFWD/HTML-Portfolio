            Diogo Albuquerque is a 25 year old web developer from Portugal. He earned most of his higher studies in Coimbra, Portugal, has always loved technology and creative
            crafts. Even though most of his upbringing was in Humanities and Social Sciences, he realized eventually how much more fulfilling and satisfying a career in web 
            development could be.

            Despite loving cats, he owns both a cat and a dog, plays the piano in his free time, and enjoys English literature. He is also quite political and a bit of a radical 
            centrist when it comes to spectrum, preferring to take the best from all wings and adapting them to a fluid and flexible system. This can also be seen in his work.
